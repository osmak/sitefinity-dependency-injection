Sitefinity and Dependency Injection
===================================

[Dependency Injection] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dependency_injection) is a software design pattern which implements [Inversion of Control] (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inversion_of_control).

To facilitate the implementation of the design pattern, many Dependency Injection frameworks or containers have been implemented. Here is a list of fairly popular Dependency Injection Containers for .NET:

* [Caste Winsdor] (http://www.castleproject.org/)
* [StructureMap] (http://docs.structuremap.net/)
* [Autofac] (https://github.com/autofac/Autofac)
* [Unity] (http://unity.codeplex.com/) * used by Sitefinity internally
* [Ninject] (http://www.ninject.org/)
* [Funq] (http://funq.codeplex.com/)
* [...or you can build your own] (http://ayende.com/blog/2886/building-an-ioc-container-in-15-lines-of-code)
